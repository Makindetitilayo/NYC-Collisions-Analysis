## Introduction:

This project analyzes motor vehicle collisions reported by the New York City Police Department between January and August 2020.
The purpose is to uncover patterns, high-risk locations, causes of accidents, and fatalities, and to provide actionable recommendations for traffic safety improvements.

## Key Metrics:

- Which month recorded the highest percentage of accidents?
- On which days and hours do accidents occur most frequently?
- Which street has the highest accident count, and what percentage of all accidents does it represent?
- What are the most common contributing factors for all accidents, and for fatal accidents specifically?

## Skills Demonstrated:

- Data Importing
- Data Cleaning 
- Data Modelling
- DAX Calculations
- Data Visualization
- Dashboard Automation
- Analytical Storytelling

### Analysis:

### Compare the percentage of total accidents by month to see if there are any noticeable seasonal patterns

The analysis shows that March recorded the highest percentage of total accidents at 10.5%, followed closely by January at 9.8%. The remaining months fell between 7% and 9%, indicating that accident levels were relatively stable through the rest of the year. While there is no strong seasonal trend, the slight peak in late winter and early spring suggests weather transitions or traffic conditions in that period may have contributed to increased collisions.

### Break down of accident frequency by day of week and hour of day to know when accidents occur most frequently
Accidents occur most frequently on Fridays, with approximately 37,000 incidents, making it the riskiest day of the week. When broken down by time of day, the highest peak occurred at PM, with about 15,100 accidents recorded during this hour. This pattern aligns with afternoon rush hours when traffic congestion is at its peak, increasing the likelihood of collisions.

### The street with the most accidents reported and What percentge it represents of all reported accidents
The street with the highest number of reported accidents was Belt Parkway, with about 3,700 collisions. This represents roughly 0.02% of all reported accidents in the dataset. While this percentage may appear small compared to the citywide total, the concentration of accidents on one major roadway highlights its significance as a hotspot that requires targeted safety measures.

### Most common contributing factor for the accidents based on Vehicle 1 and the leading cause of fatal accidents
Across all accidents, driver inattention/distraction emerged as the most common contributing factor, accounting for 58,000 cases. For fatal accidents, the leading cause was categorized as unspecified with 175 fatalities, followed by unsafe speed with 130 cases. These results emphasize that while distraction is the primary driver of accidents overall, speeding greatly increases the likelihood of accidents being fatal.

### Borough with the highest number of accidents
Brooklyn recorded the highest number of accidents with about 76,000 incidents, followed by Queens with 64,000. This finding indicates that Brooklyn, being both densely populated and highly trafficked, experiences significantly more collisions compared to other boroughs.

### Vehicle type most frequently involved in accidents
By vehicle type, passenger vehicles were by far the most frequently involved, with more than 201,000 collisions recorded. This is substantially higher than all other vehicle categories such as transport vehicles, taxis, bicycles, and buses. This result reflects the dominance of private cars on New York City roads and their outsized contribution to the overall collision count.

## Conclusion and Recommendation:

In conclusion, the analysis highlights several key findings: accidents peak in March, they occur most often on Fridays around 3 PM, and they are highly concentrated on Belt Parkway. Driver distraction remains the leading overall cause of accidents, while speeding is a major factor in fatal crashes. Brooklyn leads all boroughs in accident volume, and passenger vehicles dominate the vehicle types involved.

Based on these insights, it is recommended that authorities focus on implementing targeted enforcement measures on Belt Parkway and within Brooklyn, particularly during high-risk times such as Friday afternoons. Campaigns should be launched to combat distracted driving and to raise awareness about the dangers of speeding, supported by stricter enforcement of speed limits. Finally, policies and infrastructure improvements should be designed with passenger vehicles in mind, as they account for the overwhelming majority of collisions.
